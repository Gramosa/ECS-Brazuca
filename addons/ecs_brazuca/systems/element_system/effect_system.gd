## effect_name is the actual name of the effect, the value of EffectData.effect_name. effect_name can be "all", "" or the specific effect name.
## If its "all", means all effects from the EffectComponent will be applied.
## If its "" and the EffectComponent have only one EffectData, it will take these EffectData, if it have more than one EffectData, thena  random effect are take.
## source_component_name and target_component_name are used if the source_entity or target_entity have more than one EffectComponent.
